    Organizations are tasked with managing greater volumes of data, from more sources, than ever before. Whether it be machine data generated from internet of things (IoT) deployments, social media metrics, or distributed data from noSQL databases, many organizations are finding that to deliver timely business insights against massive, heterogeneous volumes of data they need a storage and analytics solution that offers more speed and flexibility than legacy systems. A Data Lake is a new and increasingly popular way to store and analyze data that addresses many of these challenges by allowing an organization to store all of their data in one, centralized repository. With a Data Lake on AWS, you no longer need to know what questions you want to ask of your data before you store it, giving you a flexible platform for data analysis.
